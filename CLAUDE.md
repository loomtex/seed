## Overview

Seed is a NixOS module that bundles k3s + nix-snapshotter + Kata Containers into a single `seed.enable = true` import. Every pod gets hardware VM isolation via Kata — this is multi-tenant infrastructure.

## Module architecture

### `module.nix` — `config.seed.*`

When `seed.enable = true`, the module sets:

- `boot.kernel.sysctl."net.ipv4.ip_forward" = 1` — pod networking (IPv4)
- `boot.kernel.sysctl."net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" = 1` — pod networking (IPv6)
- `boot.kernelModules = [ "vhost_net" "vhost_vsock" ]` — Kata VM devices
- `services.nix-snapshotter.enable = true` — nix store path resolution in images
- `services.k3s.enable = true` with Kata runtime in containerd config
- `systemd.services.k3s.path` — kata-runtime + hypervisor in service PATH
- `systemd.services.k3s.serviceConfig.DeviceAllow` — KVM + vhost device access
- RuntimeClass manifest auto-deployed via ExecStartPre (server role)
- MetalLB v0.15.3 manifest auto-deployed via ExecStartPre (server role)
- Optional `seed.k3s.dualStack` for IPv4+IPv6 cluster/service CIDRs

### Kata config patching

Three layers of patching:

**Multi-mount rootfs patch (`patches/kata-multi-mount-rootfs.patch`)**: Upstream kata-runtime only handles single-mount rootfs, but nix-snapshotter returns overlay + N bind mounts (one per nix store path). The patch fixes three issues in kata's Go shim:
1. `create.go`: Accept rootfs metadata when `len(Rootfs) >= 1` (was `== 1`)
2. `create.go`: Copy `Mount.Target` field in `doMount()` for subdirectory bind mount resolution (containerd uses Target to place bind mounts at `/nix/store/xxx` inside the rootfs)
3. `mount_linux.go`: Use `MS_BIND|MS_REC` in `bindMountContainerRootfs()` so nix store sub-mounts propagate through virtiofs into the guest VM

**CLH path fix (flake.nix overlay)**: Upstream `kata-runtime` nixpkg builds both QEMU and CLH configuration files, but only includes QEMU binary in the derivation output. The CLH config (`configuration-clh.toml`) hardcodes a path to `cloud-hypervisor` inside the kata-runtime store path, where it doesn't exist. The overlay patches `configuration-clh.toml` to point to the actual `cloud-hypervisor` package binary.

**VM sizing annotations (module.nix)**: Kata's upstream config only allows 3 annotations (`enable_iommu`, `virtio_fs_extra_args`, `kernel_params`). The module reads the upstream config via `builtins.readFile`, patches `enable_annotations` with `builtins.replaceStrings` to add `default_vcpus`, `default_memory`, `default_maxvcpus`, `default_maxmemory`, and drops it at `/etc/kata-containers/configuration.toml` (which kata checks before package defaults). This enables per-pod VM sizing via annotations like `io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.default_vcpus: "4"`.

### containerdConfigTemplate format

k3s uses Go templates for containerd config. `{{ template "base" . }}` includes the default containerd configuration, then we append the Kata runtime block. The runtime type (`io.containerd.kata-clh.v2` or `io.containerd.kata-qemu.v2`) maps to the selected hypervisor.

### Service ordering

nix-snapshotter must be running before k3s starts (containerd needs the snapshotter plugin available). The module sets `after` + `wants` on k3s for `nix-snapshotter.service`.

### DeviceAllow rationale

- `/dev/kvm rwm` — hardware virtualization for Kata VMs
- `/dev/vhost-vsock rwm` — VM ↔ host communication channel
- `/dev/vhost-net rwm` — virtio networking for VMs
- `/dev/net/tun rwm` — TUN devices for pod networking
- `/dev/kmsg r` — kernel message buffer (k3s logging)

### Kernel modules

- `vhost_net` — in-kernel virtio-net backend (host networking for VMs)
- `vhost_vsock` — VM ↔ host socket communication (Kata agent protocol)
- `kvm` / `kvm_intel` / `kvm_amd` — expected to be loaded by hardware config

## Build / test

```bash
# Check flake
nix flake check

# Build an instance image
nix build .#seeds.web.image

# Run test VM (requires KVM)
nix run .#vm

# Test in an existing NixOS config
nix flake lock --override-input seed path:/path/to/seed
nixos-rebuild build --flake . --show-trace
```

## Architecture: Seed instances

Seed is evolving from "k3s infrastructure module" to a platform where each **instance** is a full NixOS system running in a Kata microVM. The key insight: don't invent a new module system — use NixOS proper with a thin `seed.*` instance module for cloud glue.

### Instance model

A seed instance is a NixOS configuration that runs inside a Kata VM on the cluster. Users write standard NixOS modules (`services.nginx`, `services.postgresql`, etc.) and add seed-specific options for platform integration:

```nix
{ ... }: {
  seed.size = "medium";           # VM sizing (vCPUs, memory)
  seed.expose.http = 8080;        # Ingress routing
  seed.storage.data = "1Gi";      # Persistent volume
  seed.connect.redis = "my-redis"; # Service discovery

  services.nginx.enable = true;
  services.postgresql.enable = true;
  # ... standard NixOS config
}
```

### Instance options

Implemented in `instance.nix`, these options live in a separate NixOS evaluation from the node module:

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `seed.size` | VM sizing tier: xs (1/512MB), s (1/1GB), m (2/2GB), l (4/4GB), xl (8/8GB) |
| `seed.expose` | Ports to expose via k8s service. Accepts bare port or `{ port, protocol }`. Protocols: `tcp`, `udp`, `dns` (both TCP+UDP), `http`, `grpc` |
| `seed.storage` | Persistent volumes. Accepts size string or `{ size, mountPoint }` |
| `seed.connect` | Service discovery. Accepts service name or `{ service, port }` |
| `seed.meta` | Read-only computed metadata for controller consumption |

`seed.meta` denormalizes all options into a flat structure the controller reads via `nix eval --json`. It includes `resources` (vcpus/memory from size tier), and the expose/storage/connect maps.

### Instance image bridge (`lib/mkImage.nix`)

Wraps `pkgs.nix-snapshotter.buildImage` to produce an OCI image from a `mkInstance` result:

- Creates an FHS rootfs scaffold (proc, sys, dev, run, tmp, etc, var, nix/store)
- Symlinks `${toplevel}` to `/run/current-system`
- Sets entrypoint to `${toplevel}/init`
- Uses `resolvedByNix = true` — nix-snapshotter resolves store paths via bind mounts, and the patched kata-runtime propagates them through virtiofs into the guest VM via recursive bind mount (`MS_BIND|MS_REC`).

The image ref format is `nix:0/nix/store/...-seed-<name>` which nix-snapshotter resolves.

### Controller

Three k8s-native TypeScript components replace the legacy bash controller:

1. **seed-controller** (Deployment) — main reconciliation engine + webhook handler
2. **seed-host-agent** (DaemonSet) — privileged pod managing swtpm processes on host
3. **seed-builder** (Jobs) — nix build/eval in isolated pods

Written in TypeScript with `@kubernetes/client-node`. Bundled via esbuild, packaged as OCI images via `nix-snapshotter.buildImage`.

**CRD: SeedHostTask** — controller creates SeedHostTasks, host agent watches them and starts swtpm processes, updates status with socket paths. The controller reads the status to get socket paths for Kata pod annotations.

**Namespace isolation**: each flake gets its own k8s namespace derived deterministically from the flake URI. `namespace = "s-" + base32(sha256(flake_uri))[:12]`. No flake can choose or influence its namespace — platform-enforced isolation. The `SEED_NAMESPACE` env var overrides this for dev/testing only.

**Two-level reconciliation:**

Level 1 — Generation reconciliation (on flake change):
1. Lists instance names via `nix eval`
2. Creates builder Jobs (one per instance, nix build + eval)
3. Waits for Jobs, reads results from ConfigMaps
4. Computes generation hash (sha256 of sorted name=storepath pairs)
5. Renders desired state, applies to cluster

Level 2 — Continuous self-healing (always running):
- Watches pods, services, PVCs via k8s API
- Recreates missing resources within seconds (e.g. pod deleted externally)
- Reaps old-generation resources (except PVCs)

**Label scheme** — every resource gets:
```
seed.loom.farm/managed-by: seed
seed.loom.farm/instance: <name>
seed.loom.farm/generation: <hash>
```

**Stateless**: all state lives in k8s labels. The generation hash is content-addressed from image store paths.

**Deployments**: each instance is a Deployment(replicas=1, strategy=Recreate). The k8s Deployment controller handles pod replacement on image changes, restarts on failure, and rolling updates. The controller just applies the desired Deployment spec — no manual pod lifecycle management.

**Pod template labels**: pod templates only carry `managed-by` and `instance` labels (no generation). This ensures that when one instance's image changes, only that instance's pods are rolled — unchanged instances are left alone even though the generation hash changed.

**Reaping**: after applying all instances, Deployments/Services/SeedHostTasks with a non-matching generation hash are deleted. PVCs are exempt to protect persistent data.

**Event-driven reconciliation**: the controller does NOT poll. It runs one reconciliation on startup, then waits for webhook events. The webhook callback resolves a Promise that wakes the main loop immediately — zero latency between GitHub push and reconciliation start.

**Self-heal**: runs on a 60s timer independent of reconciliation. Checks that expected Deployments, Services, and SeedHostTasks exist and recreates any missing ones.

**Manifest generation**: done in TypeScript (replaces jq). Type-safe k8s manifests with `@kubernetes/client-node` types.

**Protocol handling**: the controller reads `.protocol` from each expose entry in metadata. `"dns"` generates both TCP and UDP service ports. `"udp"` generates UDP-only. Everything else generates TCP.

**Webhook**: HTTP server in the controller pod, Caddy reverse-proxies to it via k8s Service. HMAC-SHA256 verification for GitHub webhooks.

**Builder Jobs**: run on default runtime (not Kata — unix sockets don't traverse virtiofs). Mount host nix-daemon socket and nix store. Results delivered via ConfigMap.

**RBAC**: ClusterRole with access to namespaces, pods, pvcs, services, configmaps, jobs, runtimeclasses, metallb CRDs, and SeedHostTask CRDs.

**Legacy**: `controller.sh` is preserved for reference but no longer used in production.

### IPv4 route block

Public ingress via a Vultr reserved IP. The flake exports an `ipv4` output that maps external ports to instance ports:

```nix
ipv4 = {
  enable = true;
  routes = {
    dns = { port = 53; protocol = "dns"; instance = "dns"; };
    # web = { port = 443; protocol = "tcp"; instance = "web"; targetPort = 8080; };
  };
};
```

Each route entry has: `port` (external), `protocol` (`tcp`/`udp`/`dns`/`http`/`grpc`), `instance` (target), and optional `targetPort` (defaults to `port`).

The controller groups routes by instance and creates one `LoadBalancer` service per instance (`seed-<instance>-ipv4`) with `loadBalancerIP` set to `SEED_IPV4_ADDRESS` and `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`. These are distinct from the ClusterIP services created by `seed.expose`.

The `seed.controller.ipv4Address` NixOS option passes the reserved IP as `SEED_IPV4_ADDRESS` to the controller.

IPv4 services are labeled with `seed.loom.farm/service-type: ipv4` and participate in generation-based reaping like all other resources.

### IPv6 route block

Same pattern as IPv4 but with a reserved /64 block. The flake exports an `ipv6` output:

```nix
ipv6 = {
  enable = true;
  block = "2001:19f0:6402:7eb::/64";
  routes = {
    dns = { host = "1"; port = 53; protocol = "dns"; instance = "dns"; };
  };
};
```

The `block` is the /64 prefix. Each route's `host` is the host portion (appended to the block prefix) — e.g. `host = "1"` with the above block yields `2001:19f0:6402:7eb::1`. This gives each route a dedicated IPv6 address from the block.

Services are created with `ipFamilies: ["IPv6"]` and `ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack` so MetalLB assigns from the IPv6 pool.

### MetalLB

The seed module deploys MetalLB v0.15.3 via k3s auto-deploy manifests. k3s's built-in ServiceLB is disabled (it can't handle dual-stack — port conflicts when both IPv4 and IPv6 services bind the same host port).

The controller configures MetalLB on startup:
- Creates an `IPAddressPool` named `seed-pool` with both the IPv4 /32 and IPv6 /64 ranges
- Creates an `L2Advertisement` for ARP (IPv4) and NDP (IPv6) announcements
- Waits for MetalLB CRDs AND webhook endpoints before applying (race condition on fresh deploy)

All LoadBalancer services are annotated with `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool: seed-pool`.

### vTPM + sops-nix (instance secrets)

Each instance gets a vTPM device (`/dev/tpm0`) backed by swtpm on the host, enabling standard TPM-based secrets decryption via sops-nix + age-plugin-tpm.

**Architecture**: swtpm runs as a regular (non-Kata) pod per instance. Its socket is exposed via hostPath. CLH reads the socket path from the pod annotation `io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.tpm_socket` and presents a TPM 2.0 CRB device to the guest.

**Kata patch** (`patches/kata-tpm-socket.patch`): Adds annotation-based TPM socket support to Kata's Go runtime. Modifies 5 files:
1. `hypervisor.go` — `TpmSocket` field on `HypervisorConfig`
2. `config.go` — TOML parsing + CLH config mapping
3. `clh.go` — Sets `vmconfig.Tpm` in `CreateVM()` when socket path is set
4. `annotations.go` — `tpm_socket` annotation constant
5. `utils.go` — Annotation-to-config mapping

**Controller lifecycle** (when `SEED_SWTPM_IMAGE` is set):
1. Creates `seed-<instance>-tpm` PVC (10Mi, persistent TPM state)
2. Deploys `seed-<instance>-tpm` pod (swtpm socket on hostPath `/run/swtpm/<ns>-<instance>/`)
3. Waits for swtpm pod Ready
4. Creates `seed-<instance>-tpm-identity` PVC (10Mi, persistent age key)
5. Applies instance pod with `tpm_socket` annotation pointing to swtpm socket

**Instance-side** (`instance-base.nix`):
- `age`, `age-plugin-tpm`, `tpm2-tools`, `sops` in system packages
- `seed-tpm-init` oneshot service: generates `/seed/tpm/age-identity` on first boot via `age-plugin-tpm --generate`
- sops-nix module imported via `mkInstance` — instances use standard `sops.secrets.*` options

**swtpm OCI image**: Built with `nix-snapshotter.buildImage`, available at `packages.x86_64-linux.swtpmImage`. Runs on default runtime (not Kata).

**Provisioning flow**:
1. First deploy — no secrets. Instance boots, `seed-tpm-init` creates TPM identity. Public key in `/seed/tpm/age-identity`.
2. Export public key (via kubectl port-forward or controller).
3. Encrypt secrets: `sops --age <recipient> secrets/dns.yaml`
4. Redeploy — sops-nix decrypts via TPM → `/run/secrets/*`

**Instance author experience** — standard sops-nix:
```nix
{ config, ... }: {
  sops.defaultSopsFile = ./secrets/dns.yaml;
  sops.age.keyFile = "/seed/tpm/age-identity";
  sops.secrets.api-key = {};
  services.powerdns.extraConfig = ''
    api-key-file=${config.sops.secrets.api-key.path}
  '';
}
```

**NixOS option**: `seed.controller.swtpmImage` — set to the swtpm image store path to enable vTPM for all instances.

### Dual-stack networking

`seed.k3s.dualStack = true` adds `--cluster-cidr=10.42.0.0/16,fd00::/56` and `--service-cidr=10.43.0.0/16,fd01::/108` to k3s. The node must also have `--node-ip` set with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

**Important**: existing pods from before dual-stack only have IPv4 IPs. They must be deleted and recreated to get dual-stack IPs (both IPv4 and IPv6). The flannel lease also needs re-registration — delete the node from kine (`/registry/minions/<name>`) if the node was created without dual-stack.

**IPv6 in instances**: services like PowerDNS must explicitly listen on `::` in addition to `0.0.0.0` to accept IPv6 traffic from the LoadBalancer.

### Instance authoring gotchas

Instances run NixOS inside Kata VMs with `boot.isContainer = true` (set in `instance-base.nix`). This strips kernel/initrd/bootloader for smaller closures, but has side effects:

**`/run` subdirectories**: `boot.isContainer` skips some tmpfiles setup. Services that need `/run/<name>/` directories (e.g. pdns needs `/run/pdns/` for its control socket) must set `systemd.services.<name>.serviceConfig.RuntimeDirectory = "<name>"` explicitly.

**No `kubectl exec`**: Kata VMs don't support `kubectl exec` (cgroup attach fails). Interact with services via their network APIs or k8s port-forward, not exec.

**No systemd journal in `kubectl logs`**: `kubectl logs` captures the container runtime's stdout/stderr pipe, not `/dev/console`. NixOS stage 2 boot messages appear (they go to console), but once systemd starts, its journal is internal. `ForwardToConsole` doesn't reach kubectl logs either. Debug via service APIs or readiness probes.

**PVC ownership**: PVC filesystems are root-owned by default. If a service runs as a non-root user (e.g. pdns runs as `pdns`), add a tmpfiles rule to chown the mount point: `systemd.tmpfiles.rules = [ "d /seed/storage/data 0755 pdns pdns -" ];`

**Schema initialization**: Use `ConditionPathExists` for one-shot DB init services, but be aware that if a previous bad run created the file with wrong permissions, the condition will skip re-init. To fix: delete the PVC and let it recreate, or add an `ExecStartPre` that fixes ownership.

**Nix flake caching**: The controller evaluates `github:loomtex/seed#seeds`. Nix caches flake lookups for ~1 hour (3600s TTL). After pushing changes, either run `nix eval ... --refresh` on the node, or wait for the cache to expire.

### Why not ArgoCD?

ArgoCD assumes YAML/Helm/Kustomize in → k8s manifests out. Seed's unit of deployment is a NixOS closure, not a manifest. A nix eval + build step doesn't fit ArgoCD's render pipeline without fighting it. A purpose-built controller is simpler and can own the full lifecycle: eval → build → deploy → activate → prune.

### Design principles

- **NixOS is the module system** — don't reinvent it
- **Kata is always on** — every instance gets hardware VM isolation (multi-tenant)
- **NixOS activation for lifecycle** — `switch-to-configuration` handles service management
- **Content-addressed generations** — same closures = same hash = no-op reconciliation
- **Label-based ownership** — controller tracks what it deployed, prunes what's removed
- **Sandboxed eval** — tenant flakes are untrusted code, eval in a restricted sandbox (future)
